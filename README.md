### Madlib, defined
Madlibs are stories in which some words are replaced with a blank and the removed word's part of speech. The madlibber is prompted to come up with replacement words that match the parts of speech of each removed word. The official name and concept comes from activity books by Leonard Stern and Roger Price, first published in 1958.
